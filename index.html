                    Amongst online Personal Computer (PC) gamers, it has cultivated a reputation for being the 'go-to' storefront for millions of 
                    gamers all over the globe. As such, analyzing the geographic distribution of its userbase offers a key look into the general
                    geographic distribution of PC gamers across the world.
                  </p>
                  <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                    Indeed, it can be seen that there is a large number of Steam users per 10,000 population in <b>Western and European countries</b> like the United States, 
                    Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. The same can also be said for a lot of countries in <b>South America</b> such as Brazil and Argentina. 
                    However, interestingly enough, there exists a sizeable number of Steam users per 10,000 population in Asian countries like
                    <b>Malaysia and South Korea</b>, and this difference is especially pronounced when comparing them to their surrounding neighbours
                    like Indonesia and China respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                    With all this in mind, we can confidently identify geographic regions where there exists a high concentration of PC gamers.
                    For companies manufacturing hardware for PC gaming, this sort of data is crucial for pinpointing which markets they should
                    focus on and for <b>identifying new and emerging markets</b> for selling their wares. One such company is <b>NVIDIA</b>, which manufactures
                    Graphics Cards or Graphics Processing Units (GPU) that are crucial components in running PC games.

                            <b>Steam</b> runs a monthly survey in order to collect data on the PC specifications of its users, compiling and releasing
                            them in the <b>Steam Hardware & Software Survey</b> of that particular month. The September 2024 issue of said
                            survey has identified 3 major manufacturers of GPUs: <b>NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel</b>. There are of course other GPU
                            manufacturers besides these 3, but these are the major players in the GPU market. 
                        </p>
                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            Of the 3 major GPU manufacturers in the market, <b>NVIDIA</b> has emerged as the clear market dominator, with <b>over 75% of Steam users</b>
                            polled by the September 2024 issue of the Steam Hardware & Software Survey having chosen an NVIDIA-manufactured GPU
                            for their PC, compared to roughly 11% for AMD and 5% for Intel. 
                            This indicates that <b>a vast majority of Steam users prefer NVIDIA GPUs</b> over GPUs manufactured by their competitors.
                        </p>
                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            All of this begs the question: why do Steam users overwhelmingly prefer NVIDIA GPUs over that of AMD and Intel?

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            Let us then compare the <b>flagship GPUs</b> of NVIDIA <b>(The RTX 4090)</b> and AMD <b>(The RX 7900 XTX)</b> with one another. These
                            flagship GPUs represent the <b>highest-end, top-performing GPU of their generation</b> and this is reflected in not only
                            their steep price but their performance in games. To that end, we have visualized each respective GPU's average
                            <b>frames-per-second</b> (FPS) on 4K resolution at the highest graphical settings within 6 PC games 
                            (Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, Deathloop, Red Dead Redemption 2, Cities: Skylines II, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor) .
                        </p>

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            From the chart, we can see that NVIDIA's RTX 4090 completely blows AMD's RX 7900 XTX out of the water in terms of
                            sheer performance. In all 6 games, <b>NVIDIA's RTX 4090 delivered a higher average FPS</b> than AMD's RX 7900 XTX did and often
                            did so by a significant margin as well.
                        </p>

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            Combining this data with our knowledge that the vast majority of Steam users reside in <b>developed, Western nations</b>
                            and as such are very likely to have the <b>disposable income</b> to afford flagship GPUs, we can easily see that
                            such individuals will prefer NVIDIA's Flagship GPU over that of AMD's due to the RTX 4090's <b>superior performance</b>.

                    All in all, NVIDIA's unparalleled performance against their rivals in the GPU market space has contributed significantly
                    to why Steam users overwhelmingly prefer NVIDIA's GPUs over that of its competitors. Knowing this, there should be no surprise
                    that <b>NVIDIA is faring quite well financially</b>. Its stock price continues to soar by the day and this trend does not seem 
                    to be showing any signs of stopping any time soon, especially with <b>rumours of an RTX 50 series announcement</b> just around 
                    the corner which is sure to provide a significant boon to investor confidence.
